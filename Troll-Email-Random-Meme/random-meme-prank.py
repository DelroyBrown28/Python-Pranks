  Description: Who says programming can't be fun? In this video, Iâ€™m going to show you how to troll your friends.. all with Python! 
    We're going to create a python program that scrapes random memes from the internet on a timer and then mails them to your 
    friends and co-workers... forever... until you stop it.

  Requirements
  - BeautifulSoup: https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
  - Requests: https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/

  SMTP Mail Servers
    GMAIL ** see notes below
    - smtp.gmail.com
    - port 587
    OUTLOOK
    - smtp-mail.outlook.com
    - port 587
    YAHOO
    - smtp.mail.yahoo.com
    - port 587
    AOL
    - smtp.aol.com
    - port 587

    Gmail has locked things down pretty good with what it considers less secure apps. That would include access your 
    Gmail account from the smtplib library in Python. However, there is a work around. You can enable access from 
    "Less Secure Apps" by going to your Gmail account and enabling that feature. However, you should do this at your
    own peril, and after carefully reading the warnings on their site.
